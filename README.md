<!-- here we use clone for add our github file to vscode,here we use git clone and then paste our github project link -->
<!-- if we have to access a specific folder in our git demo folder then we use cd "folder name" -->
<!-- after access to the specific folder if we have to get the files inside our specific folder we have to us ls command and for getting the hidden file we use ls -a -->
<!-- for getting the status of our program to be modified or not we use git status 
     if this show nothing to commit means no change has occur to the file and if it shows modified that mean chnage occur -->
<!-- this modified file is not modify in git hub for this we have to add first useing git add "file name" and then commit "file name" using git commit -a   -->
<!-- simmilar is work for if we creat a new file to folder we have to add then commit -->
<!-- now their are many files we have to add for this we use git add .(this will add every new chnage we did in our program-->
<!-- commit command = git commit =a "some information about change" -->
